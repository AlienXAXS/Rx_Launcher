Launcher fixes:
- F5 should trigger refresh
- Enter and escape keys should work in popul dialogs windows
- Highlighted servers text is unreadable when the window is not in focus
- Filter window should not overlap server browser when extended
- Make pings update asynchronously. (i.e. show server list before pings are determined.)
- Fix focus after (automatic and manual) server list refresh. (Why is focus lost?)
